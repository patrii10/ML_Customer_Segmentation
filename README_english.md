# ML_Customer_Clustering 

This project aims to analyze a wholesale customer dataset to identify patterns and segment customers into different groups.

---

## **Project Description**
Using information about purchases in categories like fresh food, dairy, cleaning products, and others, we performed an exploratory analysis using **Machine Learning** techniques to better understand customer behavior and segment them into different groups. Once these segments are created, we can tailor marketing strategies for each group.

---

## **Main Objective**
The goal is to identify the key characteristics that group customers together, allowing us to make personalized marketing recommendations.

> What are the main purchasing patterns among customers, and how can we segment them?

## **Analysis Content**

1. **Introduction**
   - Problem Description: The goal is to segment customers into different groups based on their purchasing patterns.

2. **Initial Hypothesis**
   - It is proposed that customers can be segmented based on their purchases across different categories such as fresh food, dairy, cleaning products, etc.
   - The aim is to identify relationships between different product categories and customer characteristics.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analysis of key variables such as:
     - Purchases in **Fresh**, **Milk**, **Grocery**, **Frozen**, **Detergents_Paper**, **Delicassen**.
     - Relationship of these variables with **Region** and **Channel**.
   - Analysis of the data distribution, identification of outliers, and transformations performed to improve data quality.

4. **Key Findings**
   - Identification of purchasing patterns and customer distribution.
   - Normalization and transformation of the data (logarithmic and scaling) to prepare the dataset for clustering.
   - Creation of customer segments using clustering techniques.

5. **Conclusions**
   - Final reflections on the identified customer groups.
   - Possible marketing or sales strategies based on the segmented groups.

## ✅ **Summary and Results**

| Algorithm             | Silhouette Score | Notes                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **KMeans (no PCA)**   | 0.64             | Decent results, but poorer visual separation               |
| **KMeans (with PCA)** | 0.69             | More stable and better visual distinction                  |
| **DBSCAN**            | 0.79             | Excellent score, but sensitive to noise/outliers           |
| **Agglomerative**     | 0.78             | Strong performance and consistent group separation         |

## 🧠 **Final Model Selection**

We selected **KMeans with PCA (k=2)** as the final model because of:

- ✅ Simplicity  
- ✅ Stability across runs  
- ✅ Visual clarity in cluster separation  
- ✅ Interpretability of clusters for business use
